Hi,
I am Jadranko, working as QAA with full commitment in this role not just in matter of work, but learning different concepts, tools and frameworks.

I started working in IT in 2019 helping end users to manage their business using the software owned by my company at that point of time. This experience learned me 
that most important point of every application is user experience and their story behind it. Quality of understanding client's requirements and problems that the project
we are having hands on is trying to resolve will lead to quality architecture, software design, bug and bottlenecks free, high performant, clean code and easy to maintain 
software. Of course, with quality resource, knowledge, organization and experience that team has.
So I decided to continue my personal development in learning and working on quality aspect of software as QAA and I did not regret.

I enjoy working in software planning, analizing the project and trying to predict the potential weak spots of the application. Also, I have hands on preparing data
for testing while predicting the trafic and user behavior after deployment, creating test cases based on user stories, working on API testing, frontent testing, developing 
the project for the backend and frontend test automation, building the strategy for performence testing based on defined KPY's and executing it.

So far I was working with Postman, Filder, Rest Assured, Selenium, Gatling, JMeter, Appium etc. These are the tools I have in experience, but my point of view is that language and framework we are using are appropriate tools we chose for achieving the development goal and not main point of work per se. Java is  the language I am most comfortable but if the quality of project goal will demand other language or new framework, I will put my best effort in learning it.

My personal definition of QA in a team is that this is the person that will provide all possible help to developers with goal of delivering as quality as possible application
to client and not the guy who is blaming or pointing the finger. If you found the bug, well done, but it is not the celebration song you need to sing so loudly. 

If you are still reading, you are not borred so much, so please take a look at few projects at my account.
